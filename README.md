# Ecommerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis

This dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction?sort=most-comments), and it contains information such as customers' personal details, satisfaction scores, preferred payment mode, days since the last order, and cashback amount. I used SQL (POstgreSQL) to clean and analyze this dataset. 
This analysis is divided into several steps: 
1. Data cleaning
   - Checking for duplicate rows
   - Checking for null values
   - Handling for null values
   - Handling inconsistency values
   - Creating new columns for additional information
3. Data exploration
